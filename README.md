Random Number Guesser is a fun and simple Python-based game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, telling the player whether their guess is too high or too low, until they correctly guess the number. Once the correct guess is made, the player is given an option to play the game again.


Features:
1.Random Number Selection: The computer selects a number between 1 and 10.

2.User Feedback: After each guess, the player receives feedback:

  -----"Too high!" if the guess is greater than the selected number.

  -----"Too low!" if the guess is less than the selected number.

  -----"Correct!" when the player guesses the right number.

3.Play Again Option: After each game, the player can choose to play again or exit the game.

4.Input Validation: Ensures that the player enters a valid number and handles invalid input gracefully.



How to Play:
1.The game starts by asking the player to guess a number between 1 and 10.

2.The player makes a guess, and the game tells them if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

3.If the guess is incorrect, the player can continue guessing until they get it right.

4.After the player guesses correctly, the game will ask if they want to play again. If they answer with "yes" or "y", the game restarts. If they answer with "no" or "n", the game ends.



Technologies Used:
Python 3.x: The game is written entirely in Python, using basic control structures like loops, conditionals, and input/output.
