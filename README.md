<h1>Random Number Guesser</h1>

<p><strong>Random Number Guesser</strong> is a fun and simple Python-based game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, telling the player whether their guess is too high or too low, until they correctly guess the number. Once the correct guess is made, the player is given an option to play the game again.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1) Random number selection between 1 and 10</li>
  <li>2) Tells the user if their guess is too high or too low</li>
  <li>3) Keeps asking until the correct guess is made</li>
  <li>4) Asks the player if they want to play again after finishing</li>
  <li>5) Handles invalid inputs smoothly (like typing words instead of numbers)</li>
</ul>
